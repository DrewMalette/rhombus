	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	A game with a sophisticated computer program crafting system with haunted
	servers and possessed robots.
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	crack a server to discern os
	if you know the os you can either use a program or virus if they're compatible
	if you don't have a compatible program/virus you can use knowledge of the os
	 to craft one
	
	If this hacking ability is going to be an important mechanic in the game, it
	 needs to be justified. The world is going to revolve heavily around computers
	 and hacking. People will have legitimate and not so legitimate requests for
	 you to do. And the only way you can carry out these quests is by having the
	 right program/virus. 
	
	the city-state you flee to will help you but they're strictly on the defence as
	 they don't have the resources to launch an assault to cripple the empire's efforts
	 
	the empire targeted your town to exploit its resources and industry (it's heavily
	 centred on electronics and weaponry)
	 
	Pursuing science and technology as a spiritual path while blending it with
	 Gaianism.
	 
	Technology need not be at odds with the earth. Capitalism is truly the only
	 ethical way to bottleneck the flow and need of resources required for
	 a technological and earth-friendly society.
	 
	How to fit psionics into hacking?
	Haunted computers? Haunted websites?
	
	"Somehow, a malevolent spirit attaches itself to an advanced AI and begins
	 wreaking havoc on the network"
	 
	 
	Predecessors: Short spooky stories. And maybe a Halloween game with a few
	simple item collecting/dropping off mechanics. Maybe some choices.
	Steal a creepypasta story. One that you can make a game out of.
	
	Clean up the code and launch it on github. Do a severe audit of the code and
	beginning documenting the engine's architecture.
	
	In the meantime, learn principles of game design and world building, especially
	since you're planning on building a sophisticated Hacker-ARPG.
	
	Maybe even make a simple arcade game.
	
	Port Schizophrenia III - Deadsville II to the new engine as an exercise.
