	Let's get down to brass tax
	
	I want to make a Secret of Mana clone
	
	I like that Secret of Mana is a descendant of Final Fantasy
	 but has an action battle system rather than a turn based
	 combat system
	 
	In terms of battle system and presentation I love
	 Secret of Mana
	 
	HOWEVER
	
	I also love the SaGa series (the first RPG I ever owned
	 was Final Fantasy Legend II, or SaGa 2 in Japan).
	 
	I like the open ended nature of the games. And I like
	 the episodic stories rather than one, grand, over-arching
	 narrative.
	 
	As well, I love the different types of characters: humans,
	 espers, and mecha.
	 I find these different character types intriguing. It's a
	 break from the common race/class paradigm of so many other
	 RPGs. However, I'd like to expand upon the way they're implemented.
	 For instance, the human will have a traditional equipment
	 list, but an esper will have a psychic training tree (unique to espers),
	 and mecha will have an instrument load out, as well as
	 an equipment list (they'll still be able to use weapons as humans do)
	 
	In short, I love the presentation and battle system of Secret of Mana
	 and I'd like to use that as a substrate upon which to place a world
	 based on the SaGa series (in particular, SaGa 2 and SaGa Frontier; but
	 must acknowledge the great amount of love for RomaSaGa 3)
	 
	However, I would like to incorporate some mechanics from Pathfinder,
	 such as skills, feats, and the like.
	 
	 
	Human scenario:
	 Rioters have overpowered the police and the governor has allowed for
	  any means to be taken to defend yourself until the army arrives.
	 The player may even choose to help a police officer that's pinned
	  down by a couple of thugs. If you help the officer, that'll unlock
	  a quest chain from one of the soldiers when the army arrives.
	 
	 The player character finds a killed officer and finds a gun. He's
	  not very skilled, but one shot is enough to scare his attackers off.
