	World building
	
	Surburbia
	  - scenarios within one home or a very small neighbourhood (corner store?)
	  - trick or treating, then getting trapped in a haunted house
	  - when they escape from the house and return home, one kid goes to their
	    bedroom. there's a computer in the kid's room. For a brief second you
	    see the image of a ghost flash across their screen
	  - a dark ritual which sets the stage for The City?
	
	The City (tall building complexes, mid to large apartment buildings, businesses, parks)
	  - this is the area where the program crafting (basically the mmorpg) will take place
	  - story starts with a ghost story, maybe a film (Factory Phantoms), or maybe reading
	    a creepypasta about the Suburbia incident
	    
	Why are ghosts taking over the internet? The why isn't as important as the metaphor.
