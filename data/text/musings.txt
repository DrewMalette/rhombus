	I'm disappointed in the offerings of other video games, so I should make
	my own games
	
	I would like to see a truly open source video game that others can fork
	and use to make their own creations
	
	Think like Elon Musk (just don't blow anything up)
	Think like Tech Lead
	Hell, even think like Bill Gates (sadly, Linus Torvalds is an asshole)
	
	
	It pains me to admit that I'll never be able to save them. But I was never
	going to be able to save them. Even if I had infinite dollars and maximum
	charisma, I would still be unable to save them. I'm done with them. I'm going
	to save myself.
