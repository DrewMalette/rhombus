	Straight up rip off Final Fantasy II (SaGa Zero)
	
	An emerging evil power has just taken over a powerful city.
	
	The player, a refugee, flees to an allied city and learns battle
	skills (among others) to fight back against the growing threat.
	
	The evil ermagerd emerging power sets up a base. Perhaps you'd
	like to hack their communications. Or use telepathy to discern
	their plans. (dream sequence; imperfect at lower levels)
	
	I don't want this game to hold the player's hand. I want the players
	to have freedom over what they want to do in the game.
