	Affluent character just turned 18 and he's going out on his own. His parents have set him up
	with 2000 credits so he can find a place for himself and basically set himself up.
	
	With his parents, he lived in a condo; he's welcome to return anytime for a meal (while the sun's
	up; just send a text first)
	
	In the area there are places for rent. There is a shop to buy a phone (he already has one but
	he can get a new one; additionally, he has to set up his own phone service).
	There are cafes where he can eat. Clothing shops. A hardware store.
