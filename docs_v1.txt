On drawing and formatting a spritesheet for use with
the Sprite object, an instance of which is a member
of Mob.

Make the cells uniform (ie. make every sprite
16x16 or 32x48, or whatever dimensions you're using)

Leave one extra width of pixels at the bottom for
the size of the spritesheet's cells, its rectangle
dimensions, and its x and y offsets for rendering

from the parent directory (rhombus/)
$ grep -in "\[sprite format\]" core/*.py
this will grab the format in case you're stuck
